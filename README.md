### Hey, I'm Sergio! ✌

Motivated by curiosity and a hunger for knowledge, I explore diverse interests such as computer science, philosophy and visual arts.

I study CS at the University of Pisa and work every day to refine and perfect my skills.<br>
_The art of programming is the art of elegantly organizing complexity._
